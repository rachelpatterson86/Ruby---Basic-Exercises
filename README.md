# Ruby---Basic-Exercises

2 notes:
1. Ruby - Basic Exercises hold logic puzzles completed by me to help hone my logic skills.  It will be a work in progress.
I will also add comments with the code to explain my thought process for them so that anyone reviewing the code can see how I think.

2. I am in the process of moving all assignments from the labs repo (from when I just started learning RoR) into this repo.  
This repo should hold the refactored versions of the assigments from labs.  To see my older commits for these assignments, 
refer to the labs.

These files will all begin with 'Labs' to make this clearer.
